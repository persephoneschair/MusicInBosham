                <p>Welcome to <i>Music in Bosham</i>, a local concert series dedicated to bringing the joys of professional music to the community.</p>
                
                <p>Founded in 2016 by Artistic Director Ben Lathbury, <i>Music in Bosham</i> showcases a wealth of talented artists at the beautiful Holy Trinity Church in Bosham. Our past performers range from students on the cusp of graduation, through to artists who have graced stages around the world. We pride ourselves on showcasing local talent as well, with many of our guests living just a stone's throw away from the area.</p>
                
                <p><b>We usually meet on the first Sunday of the month at 6pm</b>, typically with a short break in winter and summer. Concerts usually run for around 50-60 minutes, which we've found is the perfect length for a Sunday evening.</p>
                                
                <p>All <i>Music in Bosham</i> events have free entry, though we operate a retiring collection and audiences are encouraged to show their appreciation in this way. This has worked well for the series, allowing us to support both the artists and the upkeep of the church.</p>

                <p>If you'd like to be kept updated with information about forthcoming concerts, or if you would like the opportunity to sing at one of our many 'Come & Sing' days, please do get in touch using the contact form to be added to our mailing list. We send around ten emails a year as reminders of what's on, so you won't be inundated with spam.</p>
                
                <p>Additionally, if you're a musician looking for your next performance opportunity, we'd love to hear from you.</p>

                <p>We look forward to welcoming you to Holy Trinity Church for <i>Music in Bosham</i> very soon.</p>
